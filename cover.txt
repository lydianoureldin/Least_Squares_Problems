Part 1 (Least-Squares Crossing Lines):
The focus that was generated is [5.0844; 5.1362; 20.5131].
The RMS error obtained was 0.2970.

Part 2 (Least-Squares Planar Registration):
1. aP.dat and aQ.dat

Estimated rotation Matrix: R = [ 0.5183 -0.8552; 0.8552 0.5183]

Estimated translation vector: t =[ -1.6111; -5.4188]

RMS error: RMSerror = 0.1621

2. bP.dat and bQ.dat

Estimated rotation Matrix: R = [-0.7105 0.7037; -0.7037 -0.7105]

Estimated translation vector: t = [-3.1415; 1.6180]

RMS error: RMSerror = 0.1513

The translation vector contained the familiar constants -pi and phi.

3. cP.dat and cQ.dat

Estimated rotation Matrix: R = [-0.7034 0.7108; -0.7108 -0.7034]

Estimated translation vector: t = [-3.3106; 1.5086]

RMS error: RMSerror = 0.6307

data represented an ellipse, which consequently had a higher RMS error. This is due to the

outlier data that may have significantly impacted the mean, which is used to calculate the RMS

error.

4. dP.dat and dQ.dat

Estimated rotation Matrix: R = [ 0 NaN; 0 NaN]

Estimated translation vector: t = [NaN; NaN]

RMS error: RMSerror = NaN

Harder to solve because r phi is 0, and so the norm function will

produce NaN when it tries to compute 0/0. As expected, this resulted in the translation vector to

contain only 0s. This means that there is no planar displacement, but we know that there is!

These strange results are because the dP contains two points that are the same, but these are

not plotted to the same values in dQ.
